# Express Library App

[mozilla site](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Express_Nodejs)

all learning in this directory was from the above, link. 
Followed as instructed, but with me trying to not look at the code supplied once I understood what was going on. 

As the tutorial was moving further away from what I wanted to get from it, I have decided to move on and revisit at a later date when working more in depth with DB like Mongo.
