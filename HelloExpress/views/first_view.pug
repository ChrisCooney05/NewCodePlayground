    //there are three ways to add text to a tag
    //space separated 
    h1 Welcome to pug
    //piped
    
    div 
      |to insert multiline text,
      |you can use the pipe operator.
    //block of text

    div.
      But that gets tedious if you have a lot of text.
      You can use "." at the end of tag to denote block of text.
      To put tags inside this block, simply enter tag in a new line and 
      indent it accordingly.
